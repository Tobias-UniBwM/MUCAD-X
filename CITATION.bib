    abstract = {To improve the management of multispectral sensor systems on small reconnaissance drones, this paper proposes an approach to predict the performance of a sensor band with respect to its ability to expose camouflaged targets under a given environmental context. As a reference for sensor performance, a new metric is introduced that quantifies the visibility of camouflaged targets in a particular sensor band: the Target Visibility Index (TVI). For the sensor performance prediction, several machine learning models are trained to learn the relationship between the TVI for a specific sensor band and an environmental context state extracted from the visual band by multiple image descriptors. Using a predicted measure of performance, the sensor bands are ranked according to their significance. For the training and evaluation of the performance prediction approach, a dataset featuring 853 multispectral captures and numerous camouflaged targets in different environments was created and has been made publicly available for download. The results show that the proposed approach can successfully determine the most informative sensor bands in most cases. Therefore, this performance prediction approach has great potential to improve camouflage detection performance in real-world reconnaissance scenarios by increasing the utility of each sensor band and reducing the associated workload of complex multispectral sensor systems.},
